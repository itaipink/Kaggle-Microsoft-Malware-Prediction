# Kaggle-Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
A code for prediction of malware using gradient boosting in a kaggle competition (ranked 12 out of 2426).
specifically I used light gbm which is an efficient gradient boosting implementation (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf). I used the package described in https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html.
